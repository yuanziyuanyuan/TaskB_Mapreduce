    This project implements a Python-based MapReduce framework for analysing passenger flight data with the aim of identifying the passengers with the highest number of flights.
    The project contains three Python files and two folders: the data folder holds the original dataset, and the result folder holds the processing results, including the partition sort file and the final sort result file.
    In this framework, each Python file has its clear responsibility and function: main.py is responsible for starting and coordinating the whole MapReduce process.map.py implements the function of the Map phase and processes the data through multi-threading.reduce.py takes on the tasks of the Shuffle and Reduce phases, and it is responsible for the Map phase output data to be It is responsible for partitioning, sorting, and ultimately aggregating the data output from the Map stage.
